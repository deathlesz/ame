# Ame
Ame is a compiled statically-and-strongly-typed programming language designed to be a mix of 3 popular programming languages: C, C++ and Rust.

For me, first and foremost, it is an opportunity to learn more about compilers and other adjacent stuff.
So I will develop this until I run out of motivation or until I consider it done :).
